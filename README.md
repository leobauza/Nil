# Nil

The `Nil Module` is a dependency of the `Zero Theme`. The `Nil Module` provides:

- The `Nil Class` which:
  - Gets menus in a easier to use format than Drupal provides
  - Wraps entities using `entity_metadata_wrapper` to create field arrays or do other field processing.
  - Gets views that have been created in the backend in an easier to use format than Drupal provides by default.
- A modification that sets all menu links to expended when they are created.
- An end point to get views in JSON format for ajax calls.
